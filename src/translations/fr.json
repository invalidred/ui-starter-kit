Please try and avoid creating SNOW FLAKE U+2744 solutions by first updating the `ui-starter-kit` before changing core implementation in your instance projects. This includes things such as replacing exisiting libraries with other ones for whatever reason. Think about scale and other devs who have to switch between projects.
